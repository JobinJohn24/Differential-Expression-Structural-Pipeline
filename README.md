# Structual Consequence Pipeline

## Overview
A bioinformatics pipeline correlating differental expression (TCGA vs GTEx) with structural protein features (AlphaFold) to identify druggable targets

## Biological question
How do differentially expressed proteins differ structually and which structural features correspond with expression changes in cancer vs normal tissues ?

## Pipeline Analysis
1.  **Differential Expression:** Comparing RNA-seq data from **TCGA** (Cancer) and **GTEx** (Normal).
2.  **Structural Prediction:** Mapping significantly expressed genes to **AlphaFold** structural data.
3.  **Feature Correlation:** Identifying druggable structural motifs within differentially expressed genes.
